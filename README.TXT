PROJECT TITLE: FinalProject
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A game made for java 101 final project
VERSION: v1
AUTHORS: Matthew Holmes
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
	Once the Greenfoot scenario is opened, the user needs 
to click the run button on the bottom left section of the IDE. Next, the 
user will see three buttons labeled, play, Firstworld, and quit. If the 
player clicks on the FirstWorld button, the gamemode will change to Third-
World. The difference between these two gamemodes is that the FirstWorld 
gamemode is considerably easier than the ThirdPerson gamemode. Once the 
desired gamemode is selected, the user can click on the play button to run
the game.
	
	Once the game is running, the user will be able to control the 
character. The character can be moved to the left by pressing either the
a key or the left arrow button, to the right by clicking the d key or
the right arrow button. The character can be moved up by pressing the w
key or up arrow and down by pressing the s key or down arrow. When the 
spacebar is pressed, the character will fire the weapon he has equiped.
The weapon fires a projectile that can damage and kill the enemies roam-
ing the game world. If the enemies collide with the user, the user will 
take damage and ultimately be killed. At this point the user will have 
lost and be sent back to the main menu. In order to win the game, the 
user must gather all of the white objects spawned in the world. Different
objects give different amount of points. Killing enemies also increase 
the user's overall score.
